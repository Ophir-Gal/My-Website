        Hey there! I'm an Israeli-American currently living and studying at the University of Maryland. 
        I grew up in Israel, served in the IDF, and then decided to join my parents who had moved to Maryland,
        where I started studying towards a Computer Science degree in spring 2017.
        Things that are pure fun for me are playing drums, guitar,and piano, recording and mixing music,
        and of course singing in the shower. Areas of computer science I'm passionate about are
        machine learning, natural language processing, and audio, mobile, and web development.
