        Hey there! My name is Ophir and I'm an Israeli-American currently living and studying in the United States. 
        I grew up in Israel, served in the army, and then decided to join my parents who had moved to Maryland,
        where I started studying towards a Computer Science degree in spring 2017. 
        My two biggest hobbies growing up and till this day are music and skateboarding. 
        Music always took a considerable portion of my time and aside from playing drums, guitar, and piano, 
        I also enjoy recording, mixing, and of course singing in the shower.
