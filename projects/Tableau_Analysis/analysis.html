  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:55%;
  padding-bottom: 10px;" src="./images/police_line.jpg">
  <p>
    <p><strong>Chicago Crimes, 2001-Present</strong></p>
    This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of 
    murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of 
    Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is 
    extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR 
    (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. I am interested in
    this dataset since I can treat this as a case study to inform me about
    large cities in general. In particular, I want to see if I can gain insight
    into  circumstances that make crimes more likely to take place, since that 
    would be useful information. <br>
    The dataset was downloaded on March 25th, 2020.

    The data is available online at:

  <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <u><strong>Overarching Question:</strong></u> 
      Do crimes have a pattern  indicating the likelihood of future crime?
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      What types of crimes are the most common in Chicago? 
      <ul>
        <li>Has this changed over the years?</li>
        <li>Does it change based on the time of year?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      What parts of Chicago have the highest crime rates? 
      <ul>
        <li>how does this change over time?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      It's been shown that burglaries often occur sequentially in the same
      neighborhood in close proximity (see this 
      <a href="https://youtu.be/YeItWHulAAU?t=460">talk by Hannah Fry</a>).
      One explanation is that after the first burglary the criminals are already
      familiar with the layout of the houses and  roads, and this incentivizes
      them to commit additional thefts in the same area.
      <ul>
        <li>Does this seem to be true about Chicago?</li>
        <li>Are there other indicators of where a crime might occur based on
           previous crimes such as economic crises or other social phenomena?
           (may require an additional dataset)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  <h2><strong>Exploratory Visual Analysis</strong></h2>
  <h3>Phase Ⅰ</h3>
  <p>In the first phase of my analysis, I provide relatively simple visualizations 
     of the data so I could get an overview of the different variables. Namely:
     check how they are distributed, whether there are any notable data quality issues,
     if there are any surprising relationships between variables, 
     as well as to perform a few sanity checks for patterns I expect to see.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/number_of_records_vs_year.png">
    <p class="caption">
      As a first step in our analysis, we take a look at the trend of number of
      records per year. As we can see, there was a steady decline in crime 
      from 2001 with nearly half a million crimes, until 2014 with roughly a 
      quarter million cases. Since then, the yearly crime rate stayed
      relatively consistent. The decrease in crimes is consistent with a
      nation-wide trend that started in the 1990s, after politicians enacted 
      harshly punitive policies. This consistency is my first "sanity check".

      <p>
        See associated article in The Atlantic:
        <strong>
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/">
          What Caused the Great Crime Decline in the U.S.?</a>
        </strong>
      </p>
    </p>
  </div>
     
  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/number_of_records_vs_month.png">
    <p class="caption">
      If we increase the resolution by looking at different months over the 
      years, we notice a yearly pattern. Crime rates tend to peak in the middle 
      of each year. Additionally, there seems to be a difference of 10 to 15 
      thousand crimes between each year's lowest and highest months. This is a
      first step in addressing my overarching question since we see that at the
      end of each year there's an expected rise of 5,000 to 10,000 in the
      amount of crimes per month by the middle of the next year. It shows that
      previous crimes, at least by their amount, indicate the amount of future
      crime. It would be intereting to see, for example, if we can get an
      indication for properties of these future crimes, such as location or
      type.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/monthly_crime_rate_of_each_year.png">
    <p class="caption">
      Above, we can see each year's monthly crime rate (an alternative version of 
      the previous visualization). It shows just how similar the monthly crime
      rates of each year are. The pattern presented
      here indicates that by the summer months of 2020, one might expect a rise
      of about 5,000 in the monthly crime rate. However, we need to keep in mind
      current events and common sense when making guesses about the future.
      Due to the global health crisis surrounding COVID-19, people are staying
      in their homes. This discourages criminals from committing acts of
      theft, so it is reasonable to expect a decrease in theft for the next
      few months. This explains the significantly lower rate for March in this 
      graph since theft is the most common crime in Chicago. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/type_of_crime_vs_number_of_records.png">
    <p class="caption">
      As we can see, the most common crimes in the data set are theft and then 
      battery. Those are follwed by criminal damage and then narcotics by a
      relatively large margin, and other crimes are of smaller magnitude and
      the differences are smaller and more consistent. This visualization
      leaves out the less prominent crime types out of the 36 in the data. A
      quick count of the top 7 types here reveales that about 20% of the types
      account for 80% of the crimes (5.6M incidents out of 7M). This is
      consistent with the famous "Pareto principle" (a.k.a. the 80/20 rule).
      The data's follwing this principle serves as another "sanity check".
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/number_of_records_vs_hour.png">
    <p class="caption">
      As detailed above, most crimes happen between 9AM and midnight or
      1AM. Between 1AM and 9AM crimes are less common. This makes sense since
      most people are sleeping at home during these hours. 5AM is the least 
      common hour for crimes in Chicago. This too serves as a "sanity check".
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/was_an_arrest_made.png">
    <p class="caption">
      Interestingly, the vast majority of incidents included in the dataset 
      describe a crime where an arrest was not made.
    </p>
  </div>
  

  <h3>Phase Ⅱ</h3>
  <p>
    In the second phase of my analysis, I investigate my initial analysis 
    questions. For each question, I create a new visualization that might provide
    a useful answer or refine previous visualizations to gain further insight.
  </p>


  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/type_of_crime_vs_number_of_records_over_years.png">
    <p class="caption">
      Here we see the top 4 most common crimes each year since 2014. The
      distribution of the types of crimes was the same for earlier years. It 
      seems that the types of the most common crimes in Chicago does not change 
      from year to year.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/type_of_crime_vs_number_of_records_by_month.png">
    <p class="caption">
      The graph above shows the 5 most common crime types for each month across
      all years in the data. The types appear fairly consistent with theft
      being the most prominent, followed by battery, then usually criminal
      damage, followed by narcotics, and assault. Therefore, the time of year
      does not significantly affect the most common types of crime.
     </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/number_of_records_for_each_ward.png">
    <p class="caption">
      After joining a shape file I found online to my original dataset, I was
      able to plot a map of the different wards of Chicago. Filtering out the
      rows in the original dataset that had a null value for the Ward attribute
      left me with 6,478,858 data rows out of the original 7,093,687. As
      shown above, the wards at the center, or downtown Chicago, are where most
      crimes in the data took place. Additionally, a southern cluster of wards 
      appears as the second most dangerous part of the city in terms of amount
      of incidents. Ward 28 has the highest amount and ward 19 is at the bottom
      of the list.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/number_of_records_for_each_ward_over_years.gif">
    <p class="caption">
      Here we see an animation I created to illustrate how the distribution of
      crime rates across different wards in Chicago changes over the years.
      Year 2001 was not included since many of the associated rows had null
      values for the Ward attribute. 
      We can see that the 2 clusters described previously (center and south)
      stay prominent thorugh most of the years, with the exception of the last
      few years, where crimes seem to be centering around ward 42. It would be
      interesting to see the same type of animation but for individual types of
      crimes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/summer2019_burglaries_ward42_animation.gif">
    <p class="caption">
      The animation above illustrates the accumulation of burglary incidents
      (indicated by red dots) in ward 42 during the summer months of 2019
      (when crime rates peaked). Ward 42 had the highest amount of crimes
      for that year. The red boxes surrounding the dots serve to indicate 
      what appears as a clustering of burglaries. Notice that within each
      cluster, it seems that there are sub-clusters of 2-3 burglaries. This
      evidence answers my 3rd analysis question. It provides some support for
      the idea that burglaries tend to occur near each other (each block here 
      is 300 to 500 feet wide). However, we don't have data about the criminals 
      who committed the crime so we don't know if it's (for example) because 
      the same criminals return to the neighborhood.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="./images/summer2019_burglaries_ward25_animation.gif">
    <p class="caption">
      Here we look at the same type of visualization seen previously, but for
      ward 25, a ward that's on the lower end of crime rates in 2019. The
      clusters here are smaller and less dense and it is easier to see a
      trend of pairs of burglaries in close proximity (each block here is about
      500 feet wide).
    </p>
  </div>
  

  <div class="entry">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      The analysis has familiarized me with important aspects of Chicago's
      crimes. I learned about the overall decline in crime rates over the
      years, as well as the yearly cycle of these rates. This has given me some
      clue about the pattern crimes in Chicago have. I've learned that the most
      common crimes by far are theft, battery, criminal damage, and narcotics,
      and that these don't seem to change over the years or thorughout
      the year. It seems that the most dangerous parts of chicago are its
      center (around wards 28 and 42) and its south (around ward 6). The
      prominence of different wards does seem to change over time. Lastly,
      there was indeed some indication that crime occurs in clusters, yet it 
      seems to me that we'd need different kinds of data to reveal a real 
      connection between different incidents (and not a mere coincidence). In a
      follow-up analysis, I would link this data to external datasets to see if
      it gives me further insight into this clustering.

    <h2><strong>Evaluation of Tool</strong></h2>
    <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "Show me" feature is really helpful and saves time and effort. 
          The user can easily create a visualization that is appropriate for
          the data in use. It is great since most visualizations are probably
          simple and can be predicted by the software. It greatly reduces the
          golf of execution. It also reduces the gulf	of evaluation since the
          little thumbnails describing the options on the "Show Me" menu make
          it easy for the user to understand what visualizations are suggested.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "drag and drop" featuer of Tablaeu is intuitive and speeds-up the
          workflow. It greatly reduces the golf of execution. It also reduces
          the gulf of evaluation since from just looking at the worksheet it is
          easy to eye-ball what variables are used, what filters, marks, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tablaeu makes it very easy and quick to built data maps. It's got
          built-in maps, as well as a capability to work with "shape" files
          that allows one to easily visualize differences between custom
          divisions of geographical areas. This was very useful when I created
          my data maps for this project.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, I found the "pages" feature super useful, since it allows the
          user to quickly alternate between different points in time (or other
          attribute) or visualize the accumulation of data over time. It was
          very useful when I created my animated visualizations.  
        </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The software is slow when working with a large dataset. Specifically,
        when you change the visualization (e.g. by dropping a field onto the
        columns bar), it can sometime take minutes to apply
        the change and the user cannot use the software until it's done loading,
        which hinders workflow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tablaue does not seem to be utilizing caching when it could be useful.
        Specifically, If you're trying to re-apply a change to the visualization, 
        even If you've loaded this change in the past, you'll need to wait the
        same amount of time as previously, since Tablaeu doesn't seem to
        cache changes to the visualization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changing labels can be difficult. Usually, you can right-click an axis
        label to change its text, but sometimes Tablaeu simply doesn't let you
        do so. I had to duplicate the measure/dimension and rename it in
        your data source for it to be reflected in the visualization.
      </li>
      <li>
        No "bypass" feature. It is often very useful to temporarily disable an
        aspect of your visualization (e.g. one of your filters). Unfortunately,
        there doesn't seem to be an option of this sort in Tableau, at least
        not by right-clicking the widget. I've found myself doing a lot of 
        removing and re-adding of widgets as a workaround.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tableau has no feature for creating GIFs. I had to tediously save 
        individual frames and use a 3rd party software to create my GIF 
        animations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <h3>Evaluation Summary and Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      In sum, I think Tablaeu is a fantastic tool with minor
      shortcomings which I hope will be redeemed in the future. I've already
      seen some users online asking Tablaeu's developers to add features I've
      mentioned (e.g. export as GIF animation), and I hope they add it at some
      point. I recommend that they add the features I've mentioned as 
      well as fix the issues I described. Doing so will significantly 
      speed-up the workflow and thus improve usability. Tablaeu is a powerful 
      software and I enjoyed working with it.
