    <h1>CMSC818B Mini-Project 2, UMD, Fall â€™20</h1>
    <i><h3>Ophir Gal</h3></i>
    <hr>
    <p>This mini-project was originally meant to be based on the paper 
        &quot;Using Soft Actor-Critic for Low-Level
    UAV Control&quot; (available on ArXiv at 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02293">
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02293
    </a>). My plan was to use the code available at 
    <a href="https://github.com/larocs/SAC_uav">
        https://github.com/larocs/SAC_uav
    </a>&nbsp;to reproduce some result as a first step, and then to use the 
    existing implementation under some new scenarios not in the paper.
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately, I've had to go through a few days of long hours trying to 
    debug the errors I was getting left and right, and <b>could not</b> get the
    author's code to run on my machine, even when using docker and even after
    discussing with the first author himself via email (see the full correspondence
    <a href="./correspondence_with_Gabriel.pdf">here</a>). The correspondence
    includes other errors I got along the way, but the last error I got when
    trying to run the project natively (on my machine) is shown below:
    <br>
    <div style="color:red; padding-left:5em">

    The issue here ^^ (I later realized) was that I had something called "pyrep" 
    (available on PyPI) when I should have had "PyRep" (available 
    <a href="https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep">here</a>). But trying to install
    "PyRep" on my machine also gave me errors which I could not solve:

    Unfortunately, using Docker was not succesful as well, I was able to
    instantiate the image and create the container but I got an error when
    trying to run the training code, the error I got is:

        I've presented the errors above because I've discussed this with professor 
        Tokekar on Sunday 11/15 on Piazza, and he said that if I show that I have done my due 
        diligence in getting things to work and there isn't an obvious workaround that I
        have not tried out, then I won't be penalized so long as I report the
        process and attach the errors I got. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I tried but struggled to find a similar yet simple enough 
        paper to run the code of and experiment with in the time left
        for the mini-project. In light of that, I decided to do the following to
        somehow still get some educational value here: below I share a humble experiment
         I performed with the <em><code>gym-pybullet-drones</code></em> environment, 
        a simple OpenAI Gym environment based on PyBullet for multi-agent 
        reinforcement learning with quadrotors (available 
        <a href="https://github.com/JacopoPan/gym-pybullet-drones">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        I ran their provided experiment code to training a signle quadcopter
        agent to fly through a gate using the 5 available reinforcement
        algorithms: advantage actor critic (a2c), proximal policy optimization 
        (ppo), soft actor critic (sac), deep deterministic policy
        gradient (ddpg), and twin delayed DDPG (td3).
    </p>
    <p>
        For each algorithm, I ran the <code>singleagent.py</code> file inside
        (under the experiments/learning/ folder) with "rpm" as the action type,
        "flythrugate" as the environment (the task), "kin" as the
        observation type (which I believe stands for kinesthetic), and a
        40,000 time steps. 
    </p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
        Running the <code>test_singleagent.py</code> file it was evident the
        the algorithms performed poorly since 40,000 timesteps appeared to be
        not enough, all of the agents simply took off and then flew for a bit 
        before immediately crashing into the ground, crashing into the gate, or
        in the case of a2c, hovering and going up aimlessly. Surprisingly, the
        SAC algorithm performed well for some of the tests. Below are quick 
        videos of these poor performences (and the succesful SAC test) and 
        graphs describing their position and velocity over time.

        I had a limited amount of time and computational power but I managed to
        run the PPO algorithm for 250,000 timesteps, which thankfully resulted
        in decent performance: video and graphs are shown below.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Reproducibility is as important in computer science as any other
        science, and can sometimes be a real issue when code bases have many
        many dependencies (operating systems, software versions, processors,
        random seeds, etc.), however, since computer is among the few sciences for which 
        experiments and their conditions can be exactly reproduced (since it's
        all virtual and depends on things like versions and random seeds) I
        think computer scientists are ought to hold themselves to a higher
        standard and make sure to keep track of all the relevant information
        and make reproducibility as easy and as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        My experiment showed that using reinforcement learning for a relatively
        simply optimal control task can take a large number of iterations to
         train if we want our models to be robust to initialization. 
         It seems that sometimes, when
        the initialization is different, the model has an easier time
        collecting rewards and completing the task succesfully. Despite the
        surprising relative success of SAC over DDPG, A2C, and TD3, due to the 
        small scope of these results, it's hard to say whether SAC has any sort
         of advantage over the others.
